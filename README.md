# RIPPLE
## Overview and Origin
* Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.[2] Ripple purports to enable "secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks." The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.
* The founders of Ripple labs are Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen
* Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a local exchange trading system in Vancouver. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.[3]

OpenCoin began development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. On April 11, 2013, OpenCoin announced it had closed an angel round of funding with several venture capital firms. That same month, OpenCoin acquired SimpleHoney to help it popularize virtual currencies and make them easier for average users.[4]

On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc.
## Business Activities:
* Main problem it solves: Developed as a currency for powering the Ripple Network, XRP allows people to send money digitally. The cryptocurrency came into being as an upgrade of Bitcoin with the aim of solving issues of high transaction costs and slow transaction speeds associated with the popular digital coin.
* There are two kinds of intended users for this ripple network
    * Network Members
        * Banks: looking to process payments for corporates and consumers. Some would also process payments for and provide 
        liquidity to other banks. These banks would leverage RippleNet to enhance their servicing to existing
        customers and drive acquisition. 
        * Payment:  providers looking to supply liquidity and expand payout
        reach for banks to increase their payment volumes. 
    * Network Users
        * Platform businesses looking to send disbursements of high 
        volume and low value to a global base of suppliers, merchants
        and employees.
        * Corporate treasury departments
        looking to send large disbursements
        across their global supply chain
        to gain greater capital efficiency,
        visibility and control.
        * Banks and payment providers
        looking to only send payments,
        rather than process them, to
        overcome the high costs and
        inefficiencies of correspondent
        banking. 
        * Consumers looking to send
        global payments through their
        bank or payment provider for
        a cost-efficient, real-time and
        traceable option.
